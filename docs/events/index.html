<p>The BioPhys Mexico City 2019 conference, the third in a  biennial series, is intended as an international, multidisciplinary scientific forum to discuss the latest developments in biological physics, including experimental, theoretical and computational methods, from a single molecule perspective to complex multi-component environments.</p>

<p>The conference is expected to boost the new paradigm of interdisciplinary approaches converging into specific problems in biological physics. Hence, the conference audience is broad: We aim to attract the attention of biologists as well as biochemists, organic chemists, engineers, computational scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. The venue is highly convenient since there are four major Research Universities in Mexico City's metropolitan area, with extensive undergraduate and graduate programs in physics, biology, medicine, engineering and mathematics.</p>

<p>The program includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Talks by national and international experts</li>
<li>Poster session for undergraduate/graduate students</li>
<li>Round-Table session on new trends in biological physics</li>
<li>A dedicated issue of conference proceedings.</li>
</ul>

<p>Due to the generosity of the sponsoring institutions, no fees will be charged
to those selected to participate in this conference.</p>

<h1 id="frontiers-at-the-interface-of-physics-math-and-biology">3rd International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology</h1>

<p>Those are the proceedings for the 3rd edition of the “International Summer Symposium on Systems
Biology”. The meeting took place at the National Institute of Genomic Medicine (INMEGEN) in Mexico City from August 4-6, 2014. This event was the first of a series of meetings to encourage the development of the systems biology in Mexico and the development of this area to tackle basic and applied research in medical and biomedical fields. </p>

<p>
This effort was supported by the Laboratory of Human Systems Biology-INMEGEN to create a scientific ambiance for discussing some methods and strategies to develop the
bases of a systemic and personalized medicine in a national and international perspective.</p>


<p>The purposes of the meeting are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Discuss some of the frontier research in Systems Biology and its applications for understanding
human diseases.</li>
<li>Create an ambiance to establish collaborations among groups that will promote different
computational frameworks for modeling human diseases.</li>
<li>Design strategies to encourage growth in this area in biomedical, medicine and genomic sciences at
the undergraduate and graduate levels since these are areas with potential for dealing with health
problems in Mexico.</li>
</ul>

<p>To reach these goals, the meeting brought together some national and international qualified experts
from different research groups, providing an excellent occasion for academic exchange between local
and foreign colleagues in a pleasant and collaborative environment. The program included plenary
lectures, poster sessions, a discussion panel and a series of short presentations geared towards
postdoctoral researchers and advanced graduate students.</p>

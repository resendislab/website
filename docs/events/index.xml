      <description>Frontiers at the interface of Physics, Math and Biology. This conference (the second in a series) is intended as an international, multidisciplinary scientific forum to discuss the latest developments in biological physics (including proteins, peptides and enzymes, among many other topics).
The conference is expected to boost a new paradigm of interdisciplinary approaches converging into specific problems in biological physics. Hence, the conference audience is broad: We aim to attract the attention of biologists as well as biochemists, organic chemists, engineers, computational scientists, physicists, and mathematicians.</description>

This is a Python implementation based on the papers of Schultz et. al. with
some added optimizations. It is based on the publications of Schultz et. al.
\[[1](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article/authors?id=10.1371%2Fjournal.pcbi.1004808), [2](http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/9789813207813_0045)\].


CORDA, short for Cost Optimization Reaction Dependency Assessment is a
method for the reconstruction of metabolic networks from a given
reference model (a database of all known reactions) and a confidence
mapping for reactions. It allows you to reconstruct metabolic models for
tissues, patients or specific experimental conditions from a set of
transcription or proteome measurements.

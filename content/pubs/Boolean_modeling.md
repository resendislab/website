Cyclic attractors generated from Boolean models may explain the adaptability of a cell in response to a dynamical complex tumor microenvironment. In contrast to this idea, we postulate that cyclic attractors in certain cases could be a systemic mechanism to face the perturbations coming from the environment. To justify our conjecture, we present a dynamic analysis of a highly curated transcriptional regulatory network of macrophages constrained into a cancer microenvironment. We observed that when M1-associated transcription factors (STAT1 or NF-κB) are perturbed and the microenvironment balances to a hyper-inflammation condition, cycle attractors activate genes whose signals counteract this effect implicated in tissue damage. The same behavior happens when the M2-associated transcription factors are disturbed (STAT3 or STAT6); cycle attractors will prevent a hyper-regulation scenario implicated in providing a suitable environment for tumor growth. Therefore, here we propose that cyclic macrophage phenotypes can serve as a reservoir for balancing the phenotypes when a specific phenotype-based transcription factor is perturbed in the regulatory network of macrophages. We consider that cyclic attractors should not be simply ignored, but it is necessary to carefully evaluate their biological importance. In this work, we suggest one conjecture: the cyclic attractors can serve as a reservoir to balance the inflammatory/regulatory response of the network under external perturbations.

Introduction: The human gut microbiota (GM) is a dynamic system which ecological interactions among the community members affect the host metabolism. Understanding the principles that rule the bidirectional communication between GM and its host, is one of the most valuable enterprise for uncovering how bacterial ecology influences the clinical variables in the host.

Methods: Here, we used SparCC to infer association networks in 16S rRNA gene amplicon data from the GM of a cohort of Mexican patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) in different stages: NG (normoglycemic), IFG (impaired fasting glucose), IGT (impaired glucose tolerance), IFG + IGT (impaired fasting glucose plus impaired glucose tolerance), T2D and T2D treated (T2D with a 5-year ongoing treatment).

Results: By exploring the network topology from the different stages of T2D, we observed that, as the disease progress, the networks lose the association between bacteria. It suggests that the microbial community becomes highly sensitive to perturbations in individuals with T2D. With the purpose to identify those genera that guide this transition, we computationally found keystone taxa (driver nodes) and core genera for a Mexican T2D cohort. Altogether, we suggest a set of genera driving the progress of the T2D in a Mexican cohort, among them Ruminococcaceae NK4A214 group, Ruminococcaceae UCG-010, Ruminococcaceae UCG-002, Ruminococcaceae UCG-005, Alistipes, Anaerostipes, and Terrisporobacter.

Discussion: Based on a network approach, this study suggests a set of genera that can serve as a potential biomarker to distinguish the distinct degree of advances in T2D for a Mexican cohort of patients. Beyond limiting our conclusion to one population, we present a computational pipeline to link ecological networks and clinical stages in T2D, and desirable aim to advance in the field of precision medicine.

Currently, methods in machine learning have opened a significant number of applications to construct classifiers with capacities to recognize, identify, and interpret patterns hidden in massive amounts of data. This technology has been used to solve a variety of social and health issues against coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). In this chapter, we present some supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques that have contributed in three aspects to supplying information to health authorities and diminishing the deadly effects of the current worldwide outbreak on the population. First is the identification and construction of powerful classifiers capable of predicting severe, moderate, or asymptomatic responses in COVID-19 patients starting from clinical or high-throughput technologies. Second is the identification of groups of patients with similar physiological responses to improve the triage classification and inform treatments. The final aspect is the combination of machine learning methods and schemes from systems biology to link associative studies with mechanistic frameworks. This chapter aims to discuss some practical applications in the use of machine learning techniques to handle data coming from social behaviour and high-throughput technologies, associated with COVID-19 evolution.

Heterogeneity is an intrinsic characteristic of cancer. Even in isogenic tumors, cell populations exhibit differential cellular programs that overall supply malignancy and decrease treatment efficiency. In this study, we investigated the functional relationship among cell subtypes and how this interdependency can promote tumor development in a cancer cell line. To do so, we performed single-cell RNA-seq of MCF7 Multicellular Tumor Spheroids as a tumor model. Analysis of single-cell transcriptomes at two-time points of the spheroid growth, allowed us to dissect their functional relationship. As a result, three major robust cellular clusters, with a non-redundant complementary composition, were found. Meanwhile, one cluster promotes proliferation, others mainly activate mechanisms to invade other tissues and serve as a reservoir population conserved over time. Our results provide evidence to see cancer as a systemic unit that has cell populations with task stratification with the ultimate goal of preserving the hallmarks in tumors.

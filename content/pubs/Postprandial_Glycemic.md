A prolonged and elevated postprandial glucose response (PPGR) is now considered a main factor contributing for the development of metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes, which could be prevented by dietary interventions. However, dietary recommendations to prevent alterations in PPGR have not always been successful. New evidence has supported that PPGR is not only dependent of dietary factors like the content of carbohydrates, or the glycemic index of the foods, but is also dependent on genetics, body composition, gut microbiota, among others. In recent years, continuous glucose monitoring has made it possible to establish predictions on the effect of different dietary foods on PPGRs through machine learning methods, which use algorithms that integrate genetic, biochemical, physiological and gut microbiota variables for identifying associations between them and clinical variables with aim of personalize dietary recommendations. This has allowed to improve the concept of personalized nutrition, since it is now possible to recommend through these predictions specific dietary foods to prevent elevated PPGRs that are highly variable among individuals. Additional components that can enrich the predictive algorithms are findings of nutrigenomics, nutrigenetics and metabolomics. Thus, this review aims to summarize the evidence of the components that integrate personalized nutrition focused on the prevention of PPGRs, and to show the future of personalized nutrition by laying the groundwork for the development of individualized dietary management and its impact on the improvement of metabolic diseases.

During tumor progression, cancer cells  ire their metabolism to face their bioenergetic
demands. In recent years, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as regulatory elements that
inhibit the translation and stability of crucial mRNAs, some of them causing direct
metabolic alterations in cancer. In this study, we investigated the relationship between
miRNAs and their targets mRNAs that control metabolism, and how this fine-tuned
regulation is diversified depending on the tumor stage. To do so, we implemented a
paired analysis of RNA-seq and small RNA-seq in a breast cancer cell line (MCF7). The
cell line was cultured in multicellular tumor spheroid (MCTS) and monoculture
conditions. For MCTS, we selected two-time points during their development to
recapitulate a proliferative and quiescent stage and contrast their miRNA and mRNA
expression patterns associated with metabolism. As a result, we identified a set of new
direct putative regulatory interactions between miRNAs and metabolic mRNAs
representative for proliferative and quiescent stages. Notably, our study allows us to
suggest that miR-3143 regulates the carbon metabolism by targeting hexokinase-2. Also,
we found that the overexpression of several miRNAs could directly overturn the
expression of mRNAs that control glycerophospholipid and N-Glycan metabolism. While this
set of miRNAs downregulates their expression in the quiescent stage, the same set is
upregulated in proliferative stages. This last finding suggests an additional metabolic
switch of the above mentioned metabolic pathways between the quiescent and proliferative
stages. Our results contribute to a better understanding of how miRNAs modulate the
metabolic landscape in breast cancer MCTS, which eventually will help to design new
strategies to mitigate cancer phenotype.

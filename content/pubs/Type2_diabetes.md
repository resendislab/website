The association between the physio-pathological variables of type 2 diabetes (T2D) and gut microbiota composition suggests a new avenue to track the disease and improve the outcomes of pharmacological and non-pharmacological treatments. This enterprise requires new strategies to elucidate the metabolic disturbances occurring in the gut microbiome as the disease progresses. To this end, physiological knowledge and systems biology pave the way for characterizing microbiota and identifying strategies in a move toward healthy compositions. Here, we dissect the recent associations between gut microbiota and T2D. In addition, we discuss recent advances in how drugs, diet, and exercise modulate the microbiome to favor healthy stages. Finally, we present computational approaches for disentangling the metabolic activity underlying host-microbiota codependence. Altogether, we envision that the combination of physiology and computational modeling of microbiota metabolism will drive us to optimize the diagnosis and treatment of T2D patients in a personalized way.

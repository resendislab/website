Research in personalized therapy has taken relevance because treatment failures due to  intratumoral heterogenety which refers to celular diversity or subpopulations
forming within the tumor. Currently, given complex molecular processes of cancer there has been greater use of omic technologies and computational analysis. With the purpuse to
contribute in this line, we have opened a new line of research to describe the progress of expression profiles in tumor cell lines through bioinformatic analysis of single cell
RNAseq data. Likewise, this work will contribute to infer the principles that guide the population heterogeneity mechanisms for the design of new optimized strategies for the
treatment of cancer.

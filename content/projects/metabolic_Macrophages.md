title = "Metabolic changes in macrophage polarization through in silico approaches"
+++

Macrophages, crucial components of the innate immune system, have the remarkable ability to polarize and adopt various phenotypes in response to fluctuations in their microenvironment. Considered as "double-edged swords‚Äù, these cells serve a wide array of physiological roles; however, their dysfunction can contribute to the development of various diseases, such as cancer, tuberculosis, and atherosclerosis. Furthermore, macrophage polarization is critically supported by metabolic shifts, and there is an exciting potential for regulating macrophage functions in different contexts by manipulating their metabolism.

The objective of this project is to use a systems biology approach to analyze metabolomic data from polarized macrophages in order to unravel the underlying mechanisms of metabolic reprogramming during macrophage polarization. Through this study, we aim to identify the specific metabolic factors that contribute to the transition between different phenotypes and ultimately, their potential use in inducing repolarization towards a desired phenotype.

Modern high–throughput biological data yield detailed characterizations of the genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic states of samples. This kind of data suffers from technical noise (reflected as excess of zeros in the count matrix) and the curse of dimensionality. This complicates downstream data analysis and compromises the scientific discovery reliability. Data sparsity makes it difficult to obtain a well-data structure and distorts the distribution of variables. Currently, there is a raised need to develop new algorithms with improved capacities to reduce noise and recover missing information. For that reason, we are developing new machine learning methods to better understand noisy and high-dimensional biological data. For example, microbiome and scRNA-seq data imputation.  Also, we are developing multi-omic data integration methods to find key variables involved in complex biological systems which is in itself difficult to handle and the problem of the high-dimensionality is accentuated in multi-omics data.

Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is a widespread disease worldwide, the etiology may be associated with gut microbiota influenced by different diet patterns. Metformin is a T2D treatment, and it is known that can alter the gut microbiota composition, but a few is known about the relation between this composition and the physio-pathological variables, therefore in this project the microbiota composition is analyzed, as well as the computational modeling of metabolism in microbiota to infer the growth rates of selected bacteria and the metabolic interactions into gut microbiota on patients with T2D under metformin and linagliptin treatment

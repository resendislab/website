Leukemia is the most common cancer in children worldwide, highest incidences and worse prognostics are for low and middle-income countries where less than 30% are cured. In Mexico 4,000 to 6,000 new cases are registered  each year. Epidemiological studies have shown the contribution of environmental factors to the development of Leukemia, but also  clinical factors such as late and imprecise diagnosis of the disease, limited access, and /or adherence to treatment, and tolerance and toxicity of antineoplastic drugs.  To confront this problem, a National Strategic Program (Pronace) was proposed for the integral study of Children Leukemia. I'm responsible for Collecting all kinds of data from most laboratories of Mexico, through the organization of a DataBase in SQL language to be publicly available, and for integral study including artificial intelligence analysis for creating models that identify risk variables, better prognosis of patients, and a deep understanding of the etiology of Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia in mexican children.

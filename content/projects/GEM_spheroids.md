Currently, oncology research has been focused on investigating cancer metabolism due to its
remarkable capacity to adapt to changes in its microenvironment, enabling it to efficiently respond
to gradients of oxygen and nutrients. In 3D spheroid cultures of MCF-7 cells, three distinct cell
subpopulations with varying metabolic characteristics have been identified, indicating that each
subpopulation fulfills specific activities within the tumor, promoting its progression and survival.

This project proposes the utilization of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions (GEMS) to model
the growth of each subpopulation. Additionally, by employing community modeling tools, it aims
to simulate spheroid growth and characterize the dynamics of metabolites among the three
communities. This research will pave the way for understanding the cooperativity between cells
and their response to different types of stress, such as hypoxia and reduced carbon sources.

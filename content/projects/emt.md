An epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a biologic process that allows a polarized epithelial cell, which normally interacts with basement membrane via its basal surface, to undergo multiple biochemical changes that enable it to assume a mesenchymal cell phenotype, which includes enhanced migratory capacity, invasiveness, elevated resistance to apoptosis, and greatly increased production of ECM components. EMT induces invasive properties in epithelial tumors and promotes metastasis. Although EMT-mediated cellular and molecular changes are well understood, very little is known about EMT-induced metabolic changes.

The project combine high-throughput data to understand metabolic changes before and after EMT in lung cancer cell lines. In particular to find main fluxes used during EMT.  To that extent we employ methods from bioinformatics and Systems Biology. Our goal is to found specific targets which could stop  or reverse EMT in cancer cells.

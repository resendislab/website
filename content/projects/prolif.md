Cancer is a very heterogeneous disease and tumors can differ greatly across and within different cancer types. Consequently, cancer is not a single disease but thousands. One property shared by all cancers is the ability to sustain chronic uncontrolled proliferation which raises the question how different cancers alter their metabolism in order to achieve consistent proliferation.

In this project we combine large-scale genomic data from DNA and RNA sequencing as well as proteomics and metabolomics to understand the connection between variations in the genotype and cancer metabolism. In particular we are asking the question whether distinct genomic aberrations such as mutations or changes in transcription can be related to respective changes in cellular metabolism. To that extent we employ methods from Systems Biology as well as from Data Science and Machine Learning in order to connect genetic information to specific metabolic phenotypes.

Our aim is to use the knowledge we gain in the context of personalized medicine, particularly the use of genotyping for the prediction of the best course of treatment for a specific patient.

+++

Employing machine learning algorithms to investigate the role of the gut microbiota in the development and management of Type 2 diabetes (T2DM). By analyzing microbiome data from individuals with multiple diabetes treatments, my aim is to identify specific microbial compositions associated with the disease and develop predictive models that assess an individual's risk of developing T2DM based on their microbiota profile. Also using a systems biology approach (MICOM) using the gut microbiota data to identify the metabolic changes in the community associated with T2DM.

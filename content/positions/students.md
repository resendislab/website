We extend an invitation to undergrads and grad students with interest to
continue his/her academic education through a Master's or Doctoral degree in one
of these academic programs: biological (http://pcbiol.posgrado.unam.mx),
biochemical (http://www.mdcbq.posgrado.unam.mx/) or Biomedical
(http://www.pdcb.unam.mx/)) Sciences at UNAM. We encourage candidates with an
academic background in biology, biology physics, biophysics, genome sciences,
applied mathematics and computational sciences. The students incorporated to one
of these programs will be guided to develop a systems biology description in one
of these areas: 

1. Identification of metabolic alterations in cancer cell lines
or animal tissues 
2. Tissue-specific genome-scale metabolic reconstruction in
human system 
3. computational modeling of metabolism in microbiota and its
association with diabetes
4. Development of computational methods to integrate and interpret high-throughput technologies such as RNAseq, proteome, and metabolome 
5. development of systems Biology schemes for the Study of Neuropsychiatric Diseases 
6. Development of computational analysis in Personalized (precision) medicine. 
   
All projects are immersed on an interdisciplinary ambiance and promote an
integrative description of the statistical analysis of high-throughput data in
genomic sciences, development of computational/mathematical modeling of
biological networks; and the physiological knowledge, these points required
for understanding the principles that support the metabolic phenotype in human
diseases. For any further questions do not hesitate to contact us via [E-mail](mailto:oresendis [at] inmegen.gob.mx).

With great pleasure we are hereby announcing the 2nd International Summer Symposium on Systems Biology (IS3B) taking place in Mexico City, Mexico from August 2nd - 4th 2016. The IS3B 2016 is organized by The Human Systems Biology Laboratory (HSBL), RAI-UNAM & INMEGEN.

The IS3B is currently the largest symposium on Systems Biology in Mexico and Latin America, and strives to unite leading researchers and students in an informal setting with the aim to present current research in Systems Biology and Systems Medicine. The aims of the meeting are:

1. Discuss current research in Systems Biology and its applications for understanding human diseases
2. Create an ambiance that enables scientific collaborations among experimental and theoretical groups working on human diseases.

To this extent we invite national and international researchers and students working in the aforementioned fields during all stages of their academic career with the possibility to present their work as a poster or short talk to a highly qualified research community.

The registration deadline has been extended until June 15th, 2016!

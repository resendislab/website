Frontier Science at the Intersection of Physics, Math and Biology
========================================================

The BioPhys Mexico City 2019 conference, the third in a  biennial series, is intended as an international, multidisciplinary scientific forum to discuss the latest developments in biological physics, including experimental, theoretical and computational methods, from a single molecule perspective to complex multi-component environments.

The conference is expected to boost the new paradigm of interdisciplinary approaches converging into specific problems in biological physics. Hence, the conference audience is broad: We aim to attract the attention of biologists as well as biochemists, organic chemists, engineers, computational scientists, physicists, and mathematicians. The venue is highly convenient since there are four major Research Universities in Mexico City's metropolitan area, with extensive undergraduate and graduate programs in physics, biology, medicine, engineering and mathematics.

The program includes:

- Talks by national and international experts; 
- Poster session for undergraduate / graduate students
- Round-Table session on new trends in biological physics.
- A dedicated issue of conference proceedings.

Frontiers at the interface of Physics, Math and Biology.
========================================================

This conference (the second in a series) is intended as an international,
multidisciplinary scientific forum to discuss the latest developments in
biological physics (including proteins, peptides and enzymes, among many other
topics).

The conference is expected to boost a new paradigm of interdisciplinary
approaches converging into specific problems in biological physics. Hence, the
conference audience is broad: We aim to attract the attention of biologists as
well as biochemists, organic chemists, engineers, computational scientists,
physicists, and mathematicians. The venue is highly convenient since there are
four major Research Universities in Mexico City's metropolitan area, with
extensive undergraduate and graduate programs in physics, biology, medicine,
engineering and mathematics.

The program includes:

- Talks by national and international experts
- Poster session for undergraduate/graduate students
- Round-Table session on new trends in biological physics
- A dedicated issue of conference proceedings.

Due to the generosity of the sponsoring institutions, no fees will be charged
to those selected to participate in this conference.

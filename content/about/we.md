Welcome to the webpage of the Human Systems Biology group in the National
Institute of Genome Medicine at Mexico City, INMEGEN. Our group is
interdisciplinary and have the objective to develop a systems biology framework
to analyze mainly human diseases and metabolic phenotype in microorganisms
through the use of computational models and high-throughput technologies.

Currently, our laboratory focuses on the analysis of metabolic alterations in
cancer cells by the implementation of genome scale metabolic reconstructions and
assess the predictions in terms of experimental data at different scales. We
have developed some approaches for modeling cancer metabolism and currently we
are developing computational schemes with capacities to integrate metabolome and
RNA-seq data for elucidating metabolic mechanism in cancer cell lines and
tissues.

Lastly, our laboratory is leading efforts to test the utility of computational
schemes to explore themes related with cancer studies, such as the influence of
microbiome in cancer, the study of the biological networks regulating the
epithelial messenchymal transition and tumor heterogeneity in cancer.

Macrophages are cells of the innate immune system endowed with the capacity to orchestrate the immune response in human tissues. Due to their plasticity biological property, they polarize to several subtypes based on the actions of the tumor microenvironment. These cells have plasticity, because once they are committed to a subtype fate, they can polarize to another subtype by simply modifying the microenvironment. We integrated experimental data for the construction of a network that will explain the plasticity and the importance of the microenvironment in shaping the polarization of macrophages. The mathematical model was used to describe the genetic control points of macrophage polarization and plasticity, and it can function as groundwork and guidance for an immunotherapeutic approach to modulate the proliferation of cancer cells.

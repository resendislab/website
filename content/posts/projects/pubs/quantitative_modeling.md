This book presents cutting-edge research on the use of physical and
mathematical formalisms to model and quantitatively analyze biological
phenomena ranging from microscopic to macroscopic systems. The systems
discussed in this compilation cover protein folding pathways, gene regulation
in prostate cancer, quorum sensing in bacteria to mathematical and physical
descriptions to analyze anomalous diffusion in patchy environments and the
physical mechanisms that drive active motion in large sets of particles, both
fundamental descriptions that can be applied to different phenomena in biology.

Since the discovery of the Warburg effect in the 1920s cancer has been tightly
associated with the genetic and metabolic state of the cell. One of the
hallmarks of cancer is the alteration of the cellular metabolism in order to
promote proliferation and undermine cellular defense mechanisms such as
apoptosis or detection by the immune system. However, the strategies by which
this is achieved in different cancers and sometimes even in different patients
of the same cancer is very heterogeneous, which hinders the design of general
treatment options. Recently, there has been an ongoing effort to study this
phenomenon on a genomic scale in order to understand the causality underlying
the disease. Hence, current “omics” technologies have contributed to identify
and monitor different biological pieces at different biological levels, such as
genes, proteins or metabolites. These technological capacities have provided us
with vast amounts of clinical data where a single patient may often give rise
to various tissue samples, each of them being characterized in detail by
genomescale data on the sequence, expression, proteome and metabolome level.
Data with such detail poses the imminent problem of extracting meaningful
interpretations and translating them into specific treatment options. To this
purpose, Systems Biology provides a set of promising computational tools in
order to decipher the mechanisms driving a healthy cell’s metabolism into a
cancerous one. However, this enterprise requires bridging the gap between large
data resources, mathematical analysis and modeling specifically designed to
work with the available data. This is by no means trivial and requires high
levels of communication and adaptation between the experimental and theoretical
side of research.
